💻 Project Features:

🔹 Built with React Hooks — useState, useCallback, and useEffect for clean and optimized logic.

🔹 Users can customize password length (starting from 8) and choose from the following options:

 1️⃣ Uppercase Letters (A–Z)
 
 2️⃣ Lowercase Letters (a–z)
 
 3️⃣ Numbers (0–9)
 
 4️⃣ Special Symbols (!@#$%^&*)
 
🔹 Added a dynamic password length controller and instant password regeneration on change.

🔹 Designed with Tailwind CSS featuring a 3D animated gradient background and smooth hover effects.

🧠 This project strengthened my understanding of React component reactivity, state management, and user interface enhancement with Tailwind.
